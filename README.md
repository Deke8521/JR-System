This project implements a job recommender system using Streamlit, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity using content-based technique. The system allows users to upload their resume either in PDF or Word document format. Upon uploading, the system processes the resume text, vectorizes it using Count Vectorization, TD-IDF or Word2Vec and compares it with job descriptions from a provided dataset. It then recommends the top 10 jobs based on similarity scores calculated using cosine similarity. Users can visualize the similarity scores through a line plot and view the recommended jobs in a table format. The project aims to assist job seekers in finding relevant job opportunities based on their skills and experience.
